          Uno Health enrolls partners with Medicare Advantage providers to help
          them re-certify their Medicare members in all state and federal

          their pockets.

        During the first week, I conducted internal interviews with Uno team
        members to learn what needs the portal was meant to solve, the most
        significant pain points facing members, and the constraints we needed to
        work with. I also looked at the existing materials shared with members
        to help them enroll by paper mail.

        After gaining an understanding of the existing process and context of
        the product, I began by sketching wireframes and defining the
        information architecture of the application. I continued to revise them
        with input from PMs, engineers, and compliance officers from the
        company. I created high-fidelity mockups to map out the user flow and
        built several prototypes to test out different mental models.

            One focus area was making sure that members could easily sign up for

            creating online accounts and remembering their passwords so I worked
            with engineers to develop a “magic-link” sign up flow.

            The focus of the MVP was to allow members upload documents via the

            members’ behalf. Since a single member needed to upload numerous
            documents, I designed a checklist interface to help them keep track
            of what they had and hadn’t uploaded.

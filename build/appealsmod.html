            Between 2015 and 2017, I was a founding member of the Department of
            Veterans Affairs Digital Service team. I led a team modernizing the
            disability claims appeals process. We encountered many diverse and
            complex problems not typically seen in the tech industry. As the
            group lead, I identified solutions to these challenges and helped
            carve a path forward for our team. Our engagement in this project
            saved millions of dollars by moving our infrastructure to the cloud,
            reducing project management costs, and hiring capable contractors.
            Perhaps most of all, the project demonstrated effective modern
            development practices in the most bureaucratic institution across
            the federal government.

            The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is one of the most
            bureaucratic and slow-moving agencies across the federal government.
            The agency contracted out most of its in-house technical expertise
            over many decades. It had spent more than
            <strong>$1 billion</strong> to build and support the system used to
            track and process disability claims, with most of that money going
            to a single entrenched software vendor. The result was a claims
            processing system called the Veterans Benefits Management System
            (VBMS). This system (like many others built for the federal
            government) was developed slowly, suffered from frequent system
            crashes, and failed to fulfill its core purpose â€“ namely, processing
            disability claims on time. The usage of VBMS resulted in a backlog
            of hundreds of thousands of Veterans' claims and hundreds of
            thousands more appeals.

            To address these challenges, the Executive Office of the President
            in the White House helped create the Digital Service at the
            Department of Veterans Affairs (DSVA) to bring the everyday
            expertise seen in the tech industry to the government. As the
            sponsor for this new effort, the White House directed us to increase
            the throughput of disability claims and appeals at the VA. This
            directive was no small feat and presented many challenges:

            It took some time for us to find exactly how we could have the most
            impact on the existing process. We spent months meeting with various
            groups across the VA, learning about their challenges and wrapping
            our heads around the many steps of the claims and appeals process.
            We took on small projects, assisting these teams to build
            credibility and goodwill. Doing so, in turn, opened us up to new
            opportunities and potential partners. Eventually, we met a
            Presidential Innovation Fellow who had been working with the Board
            of Veteran Appeals (BVA) and developed a strong relationship with
            their administrators.

          >
            In discussion with the Board, we realized that the appeals process
            had a similar workflow to the claims process but was more
            centralized with a smaller group of stakeholders. The appeals
            process relied on a legacy system called the Veterans Appeals
            Control and Locator System (VACOLS), which the agency had built over
            25 years prior on long-outdated infrastructure. The system, which a
            sole retirement-eligible employee maintained, relied on manual data
            entry and posed a significant risk to processing more than 450,000
            appeals in BVA's backlog. This process, however, remained untouched
            by VBMS to date. We finally found an area where we could have a
            substantial impact.

            We met with the Board and offered to build a replacement for VACOLS
            iteratively, efficiently, and for less money than VBMS using modern
            development practices. We also proposed partnering with the Board to
            improve or replace outdated processes. The stakeholders at BVA were
            excited to try our approach, and we agreed to partner with one
            another.

            Our first priority was allocating the funding to develop this new
            system. In a three-day "lockdown" meeting, all parties involved met
            and discussed the future project. We took pains to point out VBMS's
            track record in the claims process and that they were still at least
            a year away from having the resources available to work on the
            Appeals process. We also demonstrated our capabilities by presenting
            tech demos built across the three days and highlighting the work we
            had done for other partners in the agency to date. Ultimately, we
            were pleased to reach an agreement and got a sign-off to allocate
            <strong>$14 million</strong> in funding over two years to our
            project.

            With official sign-off and funding allocated, we hit the ground
            running. Our first goal was to develop a deep understanding of the
            end-to-end appeals process to become familiar with existing
            constraints and challenges facing the Board. We met with many small
            teams handling processes such as appeal certification, mail
            management, intake, evidence gathering and review, hearings,
            adjudication, and decision dispatch. We examined how each team used
            the legacy appeals system, VACOLS, and other systems. We documented
            their feedback about their tools and the overall process,
            highlighting pain points. We also held a collaborative design
            session where employees discussed problems with their day-to-day
            workflows and sketched solutions to address those needs.

            Using the information we gathered from our discussions and other
            forms of research, we mapped out a new and more efficient appeals
            process and created initial mockups for each workflow in that
            process. We even conducted a 60-day sprint to build a prototype
            using those ideas and actual data from the VACOLS database as a
            pilot to validate our approach.

            As a result of our research, we recommended developing the new
            system as a platform, another strategy often seen in the tech
            industry. I described the platform to our collaborators like a
            puzzle of different pieces. Each piece could connect with others to
            make up a whole. Some of these pieces were ones we could build
            ourselves, and others could be made by contractors or purchased. As
            we grew, we knew we could add more pieces or re-use the ones we'd
            already built to extend the puzzle (our system). This platform
            approach would enable us to be more responsive to BVA's needs and
            adapt to process and policy changes.

            class="text-kh-navy text-lg lg:text-lg font-light leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed mb-8 max-w-prose"
          >
            This approach required a high level of commitment and communication
            to ensure the project's success. We didn't know what the system
            would look like at the end because we knew circumstances would
            change incrementally. On the other hand, we knew that by scoping and
            delivering smaller pieces in smaller batches, we would feel a sense
            of progress throughout the development.

            The technical development of Caseflow was similar to what one would
            typically see in an early-stage startup. We used infrastructure and
            development tools that were commonplace in the tech industry. We set
            up a DevOps team, used a continuous development methodology, and
            took advantage of automated testing. These were new and different
            approaches than the VA was used to and presented unique challenges.
            We needed to spend lots of time educating security-minded employees
            about some of the tools we were using or explaining how these
            approaches were more efficient than what the VA was used to.

            The VA hosted some 632 applications in production on-premise and
            almost none within the cloud. Our team worked closely with other
            DSVA team members to set up Caseflow as one of the agency's earliest
            adopters of Amazon Web Services. The team needed to work alongside
            diverse stakeholders (such as the Inspector General, Network Ops,
            Information Security Officers, and in-house acquisition staff) to
            receive an Authority to Operate the cloud infrastructure.

            Another hurdle was connecting Caseflow to VBMS to get the latest
            information about a claim or appeal. To do this, we needed VBMS to
            write new APIs. VBMS only issued two software releases yearly. In
            contrast, our team launched updates every two weeks. Our development
            cycles' cadence was very different, making it hard for us to get the
            changes added quickly.

            class="text-kh-navy text-lg lg:text-lg font-light leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed mb-8 max-w-prose"
          >
            After a lot of consternation, we solved this problem with money. We
            paid VBMS to give us the time of some of their engineers outside
            their normal development process. Doing so allowed us to expedite
            the creation of the VBMS functionality we needed.

            We designed Caseflow to replace VACOLS over time. Our first step was
            using a "lift and shift" strategy to move VACOLS into the cloud.
            Doing so eliminated the disaster scenario of VACOLS' single
            on-premises server getting corrupted and grinding the appeals
            process to a halt. It also allowed us to break off functionality
            from VACOLS once we replicated or replaced it in Caseflow.

            with Veteran Service Organizations that provide support and services
            to Veterans outside the VA. We also responded to numerous
            congressional and Government Accountability Office requests for
            information on our progress.

            Dealing with VA Bureaucracy
          </h3>

            The most pervasive challenges we confronted were those relating to
            the VA's bureaucracy. We constantly struggled with the "check-box"
            culture that permeated the organization. We attended meetings with
            more than 240 people who all had to sign off on our next steps. We
            encountered opaque and long internal processes, such as producing
            Risk-Based Decision documents to use other VA systems. Other teams
            asked us to conduct security scans that would return false
            positives. When we tried to explain them back to the team, they
            lacked the technical expertise to understand them and failed us
            anyway. We often spent months negotiating with and trying to get
            support from other groups when we needed to integrate with their
            services. Employees acted out of fear and risk aversion. This
            environment made it especially hard for our team, who had come to
            the agency with relatively new and untested methods for the
            government.
          </p>

          <p
            class="text-kh-navy text-lg lg:text-lg font-light leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed mb-8 max-w-prose"
          >
            Early on, we realized we would need to insulate our team from the
            agency's stifling and sometimes toxic culture. We came up with
            several strategies to provide this protection:
          </p>

          <ul
            class="text-kh-navy text-lg lg:text-lg font-light leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed mb-8 ml-8 list-decimal list-outside max-w-prose"
          >
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              We structured the team such that my PMs would manage VA processes
              and stakeholders outwardly while I managed our team and
              collaborators inwardly. This double layer of protection prevented
              churn in Caseflow's development when needed.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              We recruited VA employees as agency experts who were familiar with
              the VA's processes and able to help us meet, sidestep, or improve
              them.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              We focused on meeting the VA's existing needs in our own ways. For
              example, the 508-compliance office required that every production
              application submit its code for manual accessibility testing once
              per quarter. Instead, we set up automated testing that checked for
              accessibility issues on every code commit, a more rigorous
              standard that the 508-compliance office loved.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              We developed strong escalation paths both inside and outside of
              the agency. We worked closely with the agency's Chief Technology
              Officer, Deputy Secretary, and the USDS Administrator from the
              White House. Sometimes, this would result in a letter of support
              or exemption from someone high up in the organization.
              Occasionally, the president would even check our progress and
              offer support.

            Yet another area where we brought everyday tech industry practices
            to the government was how we launched Caseflow. Typically,
            government agencies roll out new systems to all relevant employees
            simultaneously. When they do so, employees often encounter
            overlooked bugs and edge cases that result in work stoppage and
            negative feelings toward the new software.

            To ensure a smooth rollout, we focused on three areas:
          </p>

          <ul
            class="text-kh-navy text-lg lg:text-lg font-light leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed mb-8 ml-8 list-disc list-outside max-w-prose"

            class="text-kh-navy text-lg lg:text-lg font-light leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed mb-8 max-w-prose"
          >
            For help content, we created a brief video walkthrough using
            Caseflow and provided an online manual accessible directly from
            within the Caseflow app. For support and feedback, we set up a
            dedicated phone line, email address, and an in-app feedback form. To
            roll out Caseflow gradually:

          >
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              We first launched Caseflow in a single office with a handful of
              employees over two weeks. We visited them in person to provide
              responsive on-site support if and when they encountered issues.
              After these two weeks, we addressed many of the most prominent and
              pressing problems.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              We rolled out to three additional offices over the next two weeks,
              this time providing remote tech support. Once again, these
              employees found edge cases and bugs that we had yet to account
              for, but there were fewer than before.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 pl-4">
              Finally, once we felt we'd worked out most of the kinks, we rolled
              out to the remaining regional offices across the entire agency. We
              were still on alert while onboarding new users, but as the number
              of novel issues users encountered dwindled, we handed off our work
              to a dedicated support team.

            We knew we needed to bring on more team members. Instead of working
            on a single pilot project, we needed to work on multiple components
            addressing different Appeals workflows simultaneously. We designed
            and used a novel software development contract. Doing so allowed us
            to hire additional high-quality engineers, designers, product
            managers, and support staff, giving the project more than thirty
            team members. We divided these contractors into smaller sub-teams.

            When we identified a new potential Caseflow workflow, we sent out an
            Advance Team to conduct research, learn about the existing
            processes, and identify opportunities for improvement. The Advance
            Team handed these findings off to the development team once they
            were ready to begin working on that workflow in earnest,
            kickstarting a typical research, design, and build cycle for the
            project until its completion. This approach ensured we kept momentum
            as we continued building Caseflow's various components and gained
            ground in modernizing the appeals process.

            In 2017, at the beginning of Caseflow's development, roughly 475,000
            appeals were pending. Through our work, that number has more than
            halved to 200,000. We helped reduce legacy appeals (the oldest and
            used VACOLS) from 472,066 in 2017 to 66,000. The specific impacts
            from the Caseflow components we designed include:
